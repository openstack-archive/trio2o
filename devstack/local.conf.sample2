#
# Sample DevStack local.conf.sample2
#
# This sample file is intended to be used for your typical Trio2o DevStack
# multi-node environment. As this file configures, DevStack will setup one
# one more bottom OpenStack Pod2 running original Nova, Cinder and Neutron.
#
# This file works with local.conf.node.sample to help you build a two-node
# three-region Trio2o environment. Keystone, Neutron and Glance in top region
# are shared by services in all the regions.
#
# Some options needs to be change to adapt to your environment, read
# installation.rst for detail.
